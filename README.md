## Project Structure
project/
│
├── index.html
│    └─ Contains the HTML markup for the calculator and links to the CSS & JS.
│
├── style.css (Optional if you want a separate CSS file)
│    └─ Contains all styling for layout, colors, fonts, and hover effects.
│
└── script.js (Optional if you want a separate JS file)
     └─ Handles all calculator functionality, including user input and display updates.




- **HTML** (`index.html`)  
  Defines the calculator layout, including the display and buttons.

- **CSS** (`style.css`)  
  Manages the styling, colors, and grid layout of the calculator.

- **JavaScript** (`script.js`)  
  Listens for button clicks, updates the display, and performs calculations.

> In the single-file version, all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are included in `index.html`. In a multi-file setup, you’ll link `style.css` and `script.js` in `index.html`.

## Customization

1. **Add More Operations**:  
   - You can add additional operators (like percentage `%`, square root, exponent, etc.) by creating new buttons and handling them in your JavaScript code.

2. **Change Layout or Colors**:  
   - Edit the CSS grid properties or colors to customize the calculator’s look and feel.

3. **Accessibility**:  
   - Consider adding `aria-label` attributes or enabling keyboard support for better accessibility.
